__STRENGTH__
- Flavor_text: Hot smoke burned Donald’s nostrils and filled his lungs with
soot. Flamesshotup the curtainsandcast adevilishglow on the walls.
The fire licked at him like a starved dog. Donald anticipated the bite
at any moment. He had to get out of the room, but the earthquake
had dropped a beam over the exit. Just a couple ofinches; that’s all
he needed to squeeze through the crack. His magic wouldn’t help him
-he’d used up all his juice surviving the quake. So, Donald wrapped
his arms around the beam and put his back into it.
- Description:The points you assign to your character’s Strength Attribute
represent how much brute strength she has. Strength
determines how much weight she can lift, carry or push. It
directs how far she can jump. Furthermore, it expresses how
hard she can hit another character or object, as well as how
much damage she can do during hand-to-hand combat. When
determining the damage your character inflicts with a hand-tohand
attack, you add her Strength score to your damage dice pool.
